soxr: SoXR (The SoX Resampler library)
soxr:
soxr: The SoX Resampler library `libsoxr' performs one-dimensional sample-rate
soxr: conversion - it may be used, for example, to resample PCM-encoded audio.
soxr: It aims to give fast and high quality results for any constant (rational
soxr: or irrational) resampling ratio. Phase-response, preserved bandwidth,
soxr: aliasing, and rejection level parameters are all configurable;
soxr: alternatively, simple `preset' configurations may be selected.
soxr: An experimental, variable-rate resampling mode of operation is also included.
